The aim of _phpdaily_ project is to provide a simple way to test the future features of the PHP language. To achieve this goal, I've created some Docker images for all current development branches (from PHP 7.1, which only have a security support, to 8.0). Beyond that, I want to have a workspace to share article which describe, explain and demonstrate some newer features. So this is why I decided to create this blog.
